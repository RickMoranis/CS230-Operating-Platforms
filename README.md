# CS230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is a gaming software company who came to us looking to turn their game Draw It or Lose It into a multiplatform online team game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  One thing we did very well in the design of this document was to make sure we addressed every possibe issue our client may have when undertaking the task of moving this
  game across multiple platforms and all the technical issues that are involved in that process.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Working through this document helped to give order to this project and allowed me to focus step by step on the process which was helpful when developing the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I think if I had to revise one part of this document it would be the final section on recommendations because I feel like I could have gone into more detail and been 
  more descriptive for the client.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  In order to interpret the needs of the client I tried to think about what functionality I would want out of the game as a user or player and what would be the most
  important features and functionality towards smooth and flawless gameplay.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
